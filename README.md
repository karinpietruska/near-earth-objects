This project was completed within the Intermediate Udacity Python Nanodegree Program. In this project a command line tool was implemented in python in order to explore close approaches of near-earth objects based on data provided by the NASA/JPL's Center. For Copyright and License questions please contact Udacity. 

The udacity-readme.md file in this repository provices a detailed overview of the project, required implmentations, in depth detail on the datasets used as well as instructions on how to use. In the following, you can find a brief introduction on how to use the command-line tool based on the udacity-readme.md



## Datasets
This project is based on two datasets that were acquired via the NASA/JPL's Center. 
The dataset 'neo.csv' provides information on properties of small bodies in the solar system which usually consist of comets and asteroids.
The second dataset 'cad.json' provides information about close approaches to earth of these near-earth objects. 


## How to Use

The data can be queried using the main.py file. 
You can run 'python3 main.py --help' for an explanation of how to use the script. 
There are three subcommands named 'inpsect', 'query' and 'interactive' that allow you to query and extract information from the data. 

### 'inspect'
You can inspect a near-earth object and its properties by using the 'inspect' command. 
Take a look at these usage instructions and three examples provided by Udacity in the udacity-readme file:


```
$ python3 main.py inspect --help
usage: main.py inspect [-h] [-v] (-p PDES | -n NAME)

Inspect an NEO by primary designation or by name.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Additionally, print all known close approaches of this NEO.
  -p PDES, --pdes PDES  The primary designation of the NEO to inspect (e.g. '433').
  -n NAME, --name NAME  The IAU name of the NEO to inspect (e.g. 'Halley').
```

Here are a few examples of the `inspect` subcommand in action:

```
# Inspect the NEO with a primary designation of 433 (that's Eros!)
$ python3 main.py inspect --pdes 433
NEO 433 (Eros) has a diameter of 16.840 km and is not potentially hazardous.

# Inspect the NEO with an IAU name of "Halley" (that's Halley's Comet!)
$ python3 main.py inspect --name Halley
NEO 1P (Halley) has a diameter of 11.000 km and is not potentially hazardous.

# Attempt to inspect an NEO that doesn't exist.
$ python3 main.py inspect --name fake-comet
No matching NEOs exist in the database.

# Verbosely list information about Ganymed and each of its known close approaches.
# For the record, Ganymed is HUGE - it's the largest known NEO.
$ python3 main.py inspect --verbose --name Ganymed
NEO 1036 (Ganymed) has a diameter of 37.675 km and is not potentially hazardous.
- On 1911-10-15 19:16, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.38 au and a velocity of 17.09 km/s.
- On 1924-10-17 00:51, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.50 au and a velocity of 19.36 km/s.
- On 1998-10-14 05:12, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.46 au and a velocity of 13.64 km/s.
- On 2011-10-13 00:04, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.36 au and a velocity of 14.30 km/s.
- On 2024-10-13 01:56, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.37 au and a velocity of 16.33 km/s.
- On 2037-10-15 18:31, '1036 (Ganymed)' approaches Earth at a distance of 0.47 au and a velocity of 18.68 km/s.
```




### 'query'

The 'query' command will return a collection of close approaches based on the filters that you specify. It either displays the results in the standard output or saves them to a file. 
These instructions are copied from the udacity-readme.md file:


```
$ python3 main.py query --help
usage: main.py query [-h] [-d DATE] [-s START_DATE] [-e END_DATE] [--min-distance DISTANCE_MIN] [--max-distance DISTANCE_MAX]
                     [--min-velocity VELOCITY_MIN] [--max-velocity VELOCITY_MAX] [--min-diameter DIAMETER_MIN]
                     [--max-diameter DIAMETER_MAX] [--hazardous] [--not-hazardous] [-l LIMIT] [-o OUTFILE]

Query for close approaches that match a collection of filters.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LIMIT, --limit LIMIT
                        The maximum number of matches to return. Defaults to 10 if no --outfile is given.
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                        File in which to save structured results. If omitted, results are printed to standard output.

Filters:
  Filter close approaches by their attributes or the attributes of their NEOs.

  -d DATE, --date DATE  Only return close approaches on the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  -s START_DATE, --start-date START_DATE
                        Only return close approaches on or after the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  -e END_DATE, --end-date END_DATE
                        Only return close approaches on or before the given date, in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g. 2020-12-31).
  --min-distance DISTANCE_MIN
                        In astronomical units. Only return close approaches that pass as far or farther away from Earth as the given
                        distance.
  --max-distance DISTANCE_MAX
                        In astronomical units. Only return close approaches that pass as near or nearer to Earth as the given
                        distance.
  --min-velocity VELOCITY_MIN
                        In kilometers per second. Only return close approaches whose relative velocity to Earth at approach is as fast
                        or faster than the given velocity.
  --max-velocity VELOCITY_MAX
                        In kilometers per second. Only return close approaches whose relative velocity to Earth at approach is as slow
                        or slower than the given velocity.
  --min-diameter DIAMETER_MIN
                        In kilometers. Only return close approaches of NEOs with diameters as large or larger than the given size.
  --max-diameter DIAMETER_MAX
                        In kilometers. Only return close approaches of NEOs with diameters as small or smaller than the given size.
  --hazardous           If specified, only return close approaches of NEOs that are potentially hazardous.
  --not-hazardous       If specified, only return close approaches of NEOs that are not potentially hazardous.

### 'interactive'

The 'interactive' subcommand first loads the data so that one can run repeated queries without having to reaload the data each time. 
Here are the instructions on how to use the 'interactive' command as provided in the udacity-readme.md file:

```
$ python3 main.py interactive --help
usage: main.py interactive [-h] [-a]

Start an interactive command session to repeatedly run `interact` and `query` commands.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -a, --aggressive  If specified, kill the session whenever a project file is modified.
```

Here's what an example session might look like:

```
$ python3 main.py interactive
